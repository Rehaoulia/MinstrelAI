Minstrel is an interactive platform that combines natural
language processing and generative audio modeling to create
songs. Users provide inputs such as the desired genre and
specific keywords, which are used as prompts for an LLM to
generate song lyrics. Additionally, an audio generative model
composes melodies that align with the tone and structure of the
lyrics, ensuring cohesion between text and music. By integrat-
ing these technologies into a seamless UI, Minstrel empowers
users to explore new creative possibilities in songwriting.
